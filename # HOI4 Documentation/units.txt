# Overview
#---------------------------------------------
Land units should always include the following:

manpower = <int>                
max_strength = <int>            
training_time = <int>           
weight = <float>                
default_morale = <float>        
max_organisation = <int>        
combat_width = <int>            
supply_consumption = <float>    

Air units should always include the following:

<none>

Naval units should always include the following:

max_organisation = <int>
supply_consumption = <float>

In the unit/equipment definitions, the modifiers act as base values in most cases, whereas usage elsewhere is mostly additive/multiplicate.

#---------------------------------------------
# Base
#---------------------------------------------
max_organisation = 5           
# Additive
# Organisation indicates combat readiness and how organized a unit is. 
# Units with no organisation can't fight or move effectively.

maximum_speed = 0.1            
# Multiplicative  
# Maximum speed acts as a "bonus" mulitipler to the speed determined by the unit equipment in km/h. 
# The formula for the calculated speed is 
# <base speed> * (1 + maximum_speed)km/h; thus a maximum_speed
# of 0.5 gives a movement speed 50% faster, a maximum_speed of 2 equals 200% faster, etc.
